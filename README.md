# Server Snapshot Performance Backports
Minecraft mod that backports server performance improvements for the latest release from the latest snapshots.

Details about the optimizations can be found in the [changelog](https://github.com/litetex-oss/mcm-server-snapshot-performance-backports/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md).

## Motivation/Why does this mod exist?

Snapshots (e.g. [24w33a](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_24w33a)) can contain extreme performance improvements for servers.<br/>
However it may take months until we see these improvements finally shipped in a release.

This mod contains selected extracted improvements from the snapshots and backports them into the latest available release.
